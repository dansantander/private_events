# Private Events
In this project we demonstrate working with ActiveRecord's associations (one to many, many to many).

## Features

<ul>
  <li>A client can see all Events and create an account</li>
  <li>Users can publish events and invite other users to events created</li>
  <li>Events are displayed in Past Events and Upcoming Events categories</li>
  <li>A single event lists users attending to that specific event</li>
</ul>
